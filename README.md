# CABA Pro - Comprehensive Basketball Arbitration Management System

## Project Overview
CABA Pro is a web-based system designed to centralize and automate the daily operations of a basketball arbitration institution. It replaces manual processes such as spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, and phone calls with an efficient and scalable platform.

The system provides tools for managing referee profiles, assigning roles in scheduled games, handling official communication, and generating payment reports with precision and transparency.

## Key Features

- Referee Management: Create and manage detailed referee profiles, including photo, role (Court or Table), and level (FIBA, First Division, etc.).

- Game Scheduling: Schedule matches and assign available referees based on role and availability.

- Assignment Lifecycle: Notify referees of their assignments and track their responses (accept/reject).

- Financial Reports: Define tariffs per level and tournament, and generate detailed payment reports for each referee.
